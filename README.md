# Tic Tac Toe
 
Tic Tac Toe game made with SDL including minimax algotithm
 
  
   
To compile: 
```make```  
 
To run:
```make run```  
 
To clean:
  ```make clean```  

**The makefile only works on linux and you need to have SDL ans SDL_image installed:**  
```apt-get install libsdl2-dev libsdl2-image-dev```
  
If you are on windows you'll need to change the makefile or to use WSL
